The most recent figures \\nfrom 2015 show that total expenditure \\non research and development was Â£750 \\nmillion, the highest figure on record.  \\nEncouragingly, the number of companies \\nengaging in research and development \\nhas also increased to over 700.  \\nHowever, further significant improvement \\nis needed if we are to close the gap with \\ntop performing economies and to realise \\nour ambition of establishing Northern \\nIreland as an innovation powerhouse on \\na global stage.\\n3.11 At the same time, the local skills profile \\nhas been improving.  Between 2012 \\nand 2015 the proportion of the working \\nage population with level 4 and above \\nqualifications has increased from 27.4% \\nto 29.6% while the proportion with no \\nqualifications decreased from 18.4% \\nto 16.3%.  While moving in the right \\ndirection, the Northern Ireland skills \\nprofile remains behind many OECD and \\nEuropean Union countries, particularly  \\nin terms of the high proportions here QUESTION\\nDo you agree that the Industrial \\nStrategy should now move towards a \\nrebalancing focus?5with low or no qualifications. Improving \\nthe skills and employability of those  \\nwho face the greatest barriers to \\naccessing the labour market will remain \\na priority so that all can share in the \\nbenefits of growth.\\nCommitment towards rebalancing\\n3.12 Northern Ireland has emerged from the \\nworst effects of the global economic \\ndownturn.  There have been positive \\ndevelopments across the economy, \\nin the labour market, and on exports, \\ninnovation and skills.  While some focus \\non rebuilding must remain especially in \\nrespect of addressing issues surrounding \\neconomic inactivity and those furthest \\nfrom the workplace, we believe that this \\nsuggests our Strategy can now move \\nfurther towards a focus on rebalancing, \\none which drives further private sector \\ngrowth and jobs, one which benefits all \\nour people and one which is regarded  \\nas world class.\\n\\nClosing the Skills Gap  \\n \\n \\n43 \\n The modelling shows that a perfectly balanced skills economy will provide a significant boost to \\neconomic performance. Achieving a perfect balance between skills and economic need can be \\nregarded as an extreme, stylised scenario that is, in reality, almost impossible to achieve.  However, \\nmodelling such a scenario does provide an important context to demonstrate the significant upside \\nthat could be gained if the economy was in better skills balance. Having the correct interventions in \\nplace to ensure better skills matching would provide a significant boost to economic output.  \\nIt is important to note that the model accounts for the additional economic activity that could be \\nachieved but does not account for the savings made on search costs that businesses currently face in \\naddressing skills challenges. These would reduce, adding a further economic benefit and a dd a \\nsignificant economic boost in terms of additional GVA.
